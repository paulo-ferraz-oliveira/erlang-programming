erlang-programming
==================

I decided to create this repository to share my adventures in programming Erlang at the same time I learn about it, reading the excellent **Erlang Programming**, by _Francesco Cesarini_ and _Simon Thompson_ (if you don't have it yet, go buy it!).

No promises are made on the quality of the code that is shown here :-), as is is a work in progress, though it is expected that more recent code (higher-numbered chapters) is better structured, more performant and to-the-point than older code.

Each folder represents a chapter in the book, and the _exercises_ folder (inside each chapter folder) represents my solutions to the exercises found at the end of each chapter, most of the time easily identified by file name. Comments are used sparingly as most of the time I think the function and "variable" names are enough to understand the underlying reasoning.

This is the first time I've used functional programming languages, and though enjoying this process very much some solutions that I found may appear (to the recursive/functional mindset person) more "iterative" than they should be.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.
